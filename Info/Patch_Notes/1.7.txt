"""What's new in v1.7?
'Efficiency Update'
- Teamed up with @LinesGuy to make FBot even better!
- Removed all triggers from the file with the exception of Commands and Features
- Added two new files (Triggers.py and Triggers.csv) to check, respond and store triggers
- Added a command (FBotdev treload) to reload the csv without disrupting FBot's status
- Added Trigger.py (made entirely by @LinesGuy) with two functions
- Trigger Load Function works to check and load the csv file storing all the triggers and responses
- Trigger Respond Function which checks if the message is in any of the triggers
