# [**FBot**](https://fbot.breadhub.uk)
##### *The most annoying bot on discord*

### Features
- Turn FBot on in your channel to access its **spam feature**. FBot can also be modified to be unique to each server. You can make admin only able to turn FBot on and off, you can change the amount of messages FBot responds to, and you can even change the prefix if '`FBot `' isn't to your liking
- **FBot economy**. FBot has it's own economy system which runs on FBux, **~~f~~**. You can earn money and debt, while all the time being taxed. You can work and study, for jobs and degrees, using degrees to unlock more jobs, and spamming to increase your multipliers (similar to experience) to unlock more degrees. There are leaderboards for almost everything, you can see the people with the highest balance, highest net balance, highest debt, highest net debt, highest multiplier and highest server multiplier. With this being a fairly new feature, more commands and feautures will be added soon!
- Our own **counting feature**, allow your members to count, you'd be suprised how hard it is to be good at this...
- We even have some **fun commands**! A special Discord snake minigame, an actual ppsize calculator (it's never wrong), an 8ball feature called fball (which to date has never made a mistake), as well as some fun photo processing commands like bonk and bigpp. But there's no point listening to me, go try them for yourself!
- **Information and utility**, we have many commands for information, like a serverinfo command which gives a rundown of your server, as well as some useful utility commands like snipe (gets deleted and editted messages) and purge (also known as thanos, deletes messages). Uniquely our snipe can retrieve up to 10 messages
- FBot also guarentees **increased activity**! Don't take my word for it, listen to all those pings *they vibin*
- **Always online**. We pride ourselves in having a spam bot which functions 24/7 mostly without errors (mostly ok!)

### **So yeah we can talk ourselves up, but what do our users think?**
 > *"Oh... this bot is just spam"*
 
 > *"How do you turn this thing off?"*
 
 > *"8 minutes of my life I can never get back"*
 
 > *"Why is this thing a thing?"*
