# [**FBot**](https://fbot.breadhub.uk)
##### *The most annoying bot on discord*
### Overview
FBot is a spam bot at heart, and responds to a variety of messages when set to on in a channel, by using `fbot on`. But FBot also provides a lot of other features like an economy system, which combines all the things you love and hate about real life and just intensifies them. We also have an elegant counting feature which provides quite a contrast to our spamming feature. But it doesn't just stop there, FBot has minigames and image processing commands with more things being added every week!
