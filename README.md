# FBot
The most annoying bot on discord

Currently FBot is only being used on 5 Servers with more than 100 members

550+ lines of code


Invite FBot using this link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=711934102906994699&permissions=8&scope=bot

If your server has an unusual name, FBot will not be usuable on your server, however if you dm me on discord at @justjude#2296, I'll be sure to fix it so it works.
Also any feedback is welcome and recomendations of what to add are welcome too
