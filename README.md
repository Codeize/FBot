# **FBot**

## *The most annoying bot on discord*
Currently FBot is only being used on 480+ Servers with 30K+ members and almost 2500 lines of code

## **Don't just take our word for it:**
##### *`Oh... this bot is just spam`*
##### *`How do you turn this thing off?`*
##### *`8 minutes of my life I can never get back`*
##### *`Why is this thing, a thing?`*

## **Now featuring `FBot economy`!*
We've just introduced a new feature: FBot economy; work, study, earn money and debt, with even more new features being added soon!
